                    to look at the other teams across the Business Unit to check for areas of
                    improvement. Since Fidleity is mainly dependent on the IBM Mainframe for its
                    day to day updates. One of the task were to look at the file system, teams
                    heavily dependent on using VSAM, QSAM.<br> Analyse the like from where all those
                    updates are happening can those be done with using these files and give team an
                    alternate solution for these files, for example converting these to a Database.
                    so that it will be more effective and easy while mordenising it, when being migrated
                    different technology.
